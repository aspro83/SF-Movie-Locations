SF-Movie-Locations
==================

I chose the movie locations project for the challenge.
I did a full stack solution

Code base

App

I used


- **Backbone**
  - No prior experience 
  - Mostly used because it was suggested. I usually use angularjs but agree it would have been overkill for such a small project
- **Google Maps JavaScript API v3**
  - a little experience a few years ago
- **Python/Flask** 
  -  3 months experience
